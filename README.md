Predicting The Score of IPL Teams With the Necessary Parameters 


## Understanding Requirement

Here we need to Bulid Machine Learning model such that given the Venue or Stadium where the Game is Played between Two Teams and also the we need runs,wickets,overs,

runs_last_5	and wickets_last_5 as an input features to the model.So that this model will predict the **TOTAL** Score of the given Batting Team 


 ## Data Agoisition && Data Preparation
 
 Fortunately all the Dat
 
 
 
 ## Exploratory Data Analysis
 
 Here we want to mainly Analyse Two Things
 
 1)**Number of Games Played in Each Venue**
 
 2)**Number of Games Played by Each Team**
